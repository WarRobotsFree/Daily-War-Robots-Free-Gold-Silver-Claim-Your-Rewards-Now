### **Top Strategies to Maximize Your Gold and Silver Earnings**

While claiming free Gold and Silver daily is great, using them wisely is just as important. Here are some expert strategies to ensure that you get the most out of your hard-earned or free in-game currency.

#### 1. **Prioritize Robot and Weapon Upgrades**

The key to dominating *War Robots* is having strong robots and weapons. Instead of spending your Gold and Silver on random upgrades, focus on enhancing your most-used robots and their primary weapons. This way, youâ€™ll build a more powerful and versatile squad that can take on tougher opponents.

#### 2. **Save Gold for Premium Content**

Gold is a rare and valuable currency in *War Robots*. While it can be tempting to spend Gold on instant upgrades, itâ€™s better to save it for premium content. This could include exclusive robots, weapons, or boosters that will give you an edge in battle.

#### 3. **Use Silver to Upgrade Multiple Robots**

Silver is more abundant, and you can use it to upgrade your robots more regularly. Since Silver is easier to accumulate, donâ€™t hesitate to use it for general improvements. Upgrading your robotsâ€™ speed, armor, and damage output can turn the tide of battles in your favor.

#### 4. **Check the Shop Regularly for Discounts**

The in-game store often has special discounts on robots, weapons, and items. Keep an eye on these sales and use your Gold and Silver wisely during these periods to get the best value for your currency.

#### 5. **Complete Daily Missions for Extra Rewards**

Another great way to earn Gold and Silver is by completing daily missions. These missions are easy to complete and can give you a substantial reward if you do them consistently. Donâ€™t skip these opportunities to earn free resources.

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid When Spending Gold and Silver**

While itâ€™s tempting to spend your Gold and Silver impulsively, doing so can lead to wasted resources. Here are a few common mistakes to avoid:

- **Spending Gold on Instant Upgrades**: While itâ€™s convenient, using Gold for instant upgrades can be inefficient. Instead, focus on longer-term investments.
- **Upgrading Low-Level Robots**: Upgrading low-tier robots may not be worth the investment. Prioritize the high-tier robots that you use most often.
- **Not Saving Enough Gold for Special Events**: Sometimes, the game holds special events where you can use Gold to gain rare rewards. If you spend all your Gold too early, you might miss out on these opportunities.
